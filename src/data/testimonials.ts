Spacious, cozy rooms with all the amenities, very pleased with the perfect cleanliness, which, in general, is a rarity for India. Our rooms had spacious balconies, where it is pleasant to drink tea or coffee and enjoy the friendly singing of birds and the chirping of cicadas at night. Friendly, very caring staff, respectful of guests. We stayed only one night, ordered dinner from the menu, which turned out to be very tasty, breakfast was included in the room rate. This was the best place for our vacation during our entire 10-day trip to West Bengal and Sikkim!",

The staff is extremely welcoming and helpful. Shiwangi from reception went above and beyond to make our stay at the Grand Kalimpong comfortable and enjoyable. She is extremely helpful, friendly and made our full Kalimpong tour easier for us to navigate. Pawan is also extremely helpful, friendly and even took one of our members to the market driving his scooty at evening. The food here is delicious and breakfast is good.",
